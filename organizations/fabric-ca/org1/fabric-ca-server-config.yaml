# # Affiliations section. Fabric CA server can be bootstrapped with the
# # affiliations specified in this section. Affiliations are specified as maps.
# # For example:
# #   businessunit1:
# #     department1:
# #       - team1
# #   businessunit2:
# #     - department2
# #     - department3
# #
# # Affiliations are hierarchical in nature. In the above example,
# # department1 (used as businessunit1.department1) is the child of businessunit1.
# # team1 (used as businessunit1.department1.team1) is the child of department1.
# # department2 (used as businessunit2.department2) and department3 (businessunit2.department3)
# # are children of businessunit2.
# # Note: Affiliations are case sensitive except for the non-leaf affiliations
# # (like businessunit1, department1, businessunit2) that are specified in the configuration file,
# # which are always stored in lower case.
